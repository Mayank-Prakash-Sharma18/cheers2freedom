## Hello I’m Mragank Shandilya 

I’m an Academician, Blogger, and Digital Marketer, with speciality in JavaScript and SEO.  

I have worked in various fields, be it MNCs (corporate), armed forces, PSUs or private sector. I was a software engineer for 3 years, also worked in Indian Air Force as Flight lieutenant.

I also have vast experience with freelancing work and just enjoy the freedom that it allows me. The freedom to work from anywhere and at anytime of my choice. 

I have worked on various projects ranging from C++, .NET to Java. But my expertise lies in Javascript, Angular and Ionic. 

I am also an active blogger and own many websites and YouTube channels, from topics ranging from Digital Marketing, Coding, Competitive examinations to Career Counselling, Motivation and Healthcare. 

Apart from coding and digital marketing, I have various hobbies, such as reading novels and sports, specially Cricket, Football, TT, and Badminton.
